# BallRoller3D
This project is a combination of a game on a website looking page that is JavaScript based with CSS and HTML implemented into it. 
The game itself includes a 3D space where the player controls a 3D ball. 
The player then avoid the red obstacles and tries to make it as far as they can without colliding with any of them. 
The challenge from the game comes from the speed of the ball increasing making each set of obstacles harder to dodge.
